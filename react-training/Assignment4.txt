1.Create a React component with an input field. Implement it as a controlled component where the input value is controlled by the component's state. When the user types into the input field, the component's state should update accordingly.

2.Build a form that includes various input fields like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Ensure that each input is a controlled component. When the user submits the form, log the form data to the console.

3.Create a component with controlled input field and a button. When the user enters a specific value into the input (e.g., "show"), a new component should be rendered below the input, displaying a message. Otherwise, nothing should be displayed.

4.Build a registration form with two password fields. Implement controlled components for both password inputs. Add a validation rule to ensure that the two passwords match before allowing the form submission.

5.Construct a select dropdown menu with multiple options. Control the selected option using state. When an option is selected, display a message showing the selected value.

6.Build a simple todo list component with a text input for adding new tasks and a list to display them. Use controlled components to handle the input and update the list of tasks.

7.Design a search filter component that consists of an input field. As the user types into the input, use controlled components to filter a list of items displayed below. The list should dynamically update to show only items matching the search query.

8.Create a temperature converter component with two input fields: one for Celsius and one for Fahrenheit. Implement controlled components for both inputs. When the user enters a value in one input, the other input should update with the converted temperature.
